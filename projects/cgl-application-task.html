									<p>As this game is targeted for mobile devices, I tried to make it as easy to control as possible. Players can move their character by either touching the edge of their screen (character moves left or right) or by clicking on the ground (both left and right with additional option to move closer/farther from the camera). Both options can be enabled/disable in the game's menu. In both cases the player can click on tools placed in the 3D world, the character will move towards them and the camera changes to a close-up shot.</p>

									<p>This was my first Game Jam abroad and naturally, I was very excited. I'd never been to Warsaw before and I wasn't quite sure what to expect. Warsaw (PL) isn't very far from my hometown (merely 8 hours) and is considerably cheaper than other European cultural centers. </p>
									<p>The town was rumbling with cultural life, plenty of parks and always things to do. The locals i'd stumbled on there were very geniune and down to earth people and i felt like home. It's definitely one of my most favorite cities now :)</p>

								<h2>Written Assignment</h2>
								<p>Hieroglyphs of the future can be interpreted as a well-thought-out reflection of our time in which an influential innovation has prompted humankind to alter the world.</p>
								<p>Due to climate change, depicting a dystopian world scenario where the planet is engulfed in flames seems to be the most fitting for my game. As uncontrolled wildfires are one of today’s top concerns that could potentially result in civilisation-wide catastrophe (pg10), this game aims to express the undesirable outcomes that can potentially await us (pg15). It could be interpreted as a wake-up call to change our ways before it’s too late (pg16).</p>
