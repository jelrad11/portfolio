									<p>There are several gestures for each event. For example, if a dark cloud appears right above the egg the player has to form a roof-like shape/gesture to protect it from the rain. As the rain falls from the cloud it bounces of the hands and so the egg doesn't get wet.</p>
									<p>In another scenario, winter comes and all the leaves fall from the tree and bushes. The player needs to move his hand up and down around the egg to warm it up or it freezes.</p>

							<p>This was my first Game Jam abroad and naturally, I was very excited. I'd never been to Warsaw before and I wasn't quite sure what to expect. Warsaw (PL) isn't very far from my hometown (merely 8 hours) and is considerably cheaper than other European cultural centers. </p>
							<p>The town was rumbling with cultural life, plenty of parks and always things to do. The locals i'd stumbled on there were very geniune and down to earth people and i felt like home. It's definitely one of my most favorite cities now :)</p>
							<p>This Jam turned out to be a great relaxing event and also a networking experience. The organizers focused heavily on the work experience and it definitely showed. In comparison to other Jams this one was the most relaxed. There were group meals, Ice Cream, plentiful of fruits, Tea and Coffee, breads, BBQ party on the last day with grilled meat (and vegan food too), ... People from afar could also book a bed in a Hostel for a discounted price and so there was a hefty amount of foreigners participating (which was great). There was also an After Party and Pre-Party and that's where I met my team from Milano (IT). They were truly incredible and I'm looking forward to working with them again.

							<p>In this game, the player is trying to defend and protect the egg from dangers with his own hands. For the hands tracking we used a piece of hardware called Motion Leap, which is an Infra-red optical tracker that works rather well with Unity Engine. The game was initially thought of as a 2 person CO-OP game but it proved to be rather tricky to form gestures so we decided to stick with one player only.</p>
